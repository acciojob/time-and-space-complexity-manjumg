  <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

  <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. It measures how efficient an algorithm is in terms of time, aiming for optimal performance.</p>

  <p>Space complexity, on the other hand, measures the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to execute as a function of the length of the input. Algorithms with O(n) space complexity mean that the amount of memory required grows linearly with the size of the input. <b>Space Complexity</b> is a crucial consideration in optimizing algorithms.</p>
